Hello My name is Simon


How to run:
    Install the java extension pack in vscode
    Run the main java file.
    Requires Java 8 441 as 451 removes javafx.
    Eclipse should function also


This project is a music library created for my Java class at my college. It consists of demonstration of learned topics needed for a java certificate
including non linear data structures (trees), JavaFX GUI programming, OOP, Exceptions, etc. 

Several features include the ability to add and manage albums or singles simulating a music library. You are able to add and delete albums,
add songs to them, add or manage singles, most things you would probably find on Spotify (minus playing the songs of course)

Possible ideas for the future
    -add the ability for seperate music libraries
    -change the mechanism for loading seperate scenes so they are not recreated each time
    -organize the gui more so that it looks correct when stretching the window
